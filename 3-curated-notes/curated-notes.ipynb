      "The session focused on the National diagnostics protocol (PNDS) for Rett Syndrome, which was created based on an extensive literature review and input from experts. The role of general practitioners in the treatment plan was emphasized, as they need to be able to identify the specialists that Rett Syndrome patients may need based on their specific phenotype. The importance of considering puberty and the transition into adult life was highlighted, as early detection and treatment of comorbidities can optimize development and prevent emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The session provided a graphic overview of the medical revisions recommended in the protocol, including recommendations for addressing motor and respiratory disorders. Breathing problems, except for sleep apnea, do not have specific treatments, so the aim for general practitioners is to detect sleep apnea through polysomnography and assess its nutritional impact. Cardiac problems were also discussed, with 15% of Rett Syndrome girls experiencing QTc prolongation and reduced heart pace. General practitioners were advised to avoid certain medications, such as fluoxetine, and to exercise caution with anesthesia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gastrointestinal problems, such as abdominal pain and bloating, were highlighted as common issues in Rett Syndrome patients. General practitioners were encouraged to be knowledgeable about these symptoms, as they can lead to reflux, irritability, poor sleep, and burping. The session provided common treatment recommendations for each comorbidity in the protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undernourishment was discussed, with specific growth curves for Rett Syndrome patients mentioned. Gastrostomy may be necessary if feeding takes longer than 30 minutes per meal, and general practitioners were advised to consider the reasons behind difficulties with chewing and swallowing. Osteopenia, scoliosis, and orthopedic problems were also addressed, with recommendations for increasing vitamin D and calcium intake, regular scoliosis revisions, and training parents on how to manage joint problems to potentially prevent surgical interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gynecological revisions were mentioned, with irregular periods and premature menstruation being common in Rett Syndrome patients. The regulation of periods with medication was noted as a sensitive topic, as it can also affect bone health.\n",
      "\n",
      "The session emphasized the importance of Rett Centers, which aim to address the most important concerns for Rett Syndrome patients and their families, such as communication, epilepsy control, hand use, walking, sleep, and bowel movements. The objective is to develop enhanced treatment through a multidisciplinary approach, with the understanding that it is not enough for patients to visit separate doctors, but rather for the medical team to coordinate and work together. The lack of a dedicated Rett Center in France was mentioned, with the existing centers being more focused on polyhandicap conditions.\n",
      "Translate result:\n",
      "La sesión se centró en el Protocolo Nacional de Diagnóstico (PNDS) para el Síndrome de Rett, el cual fue creado en base a una extensa revisión de literatura y aportes de expertos. Se enfatizó el papel de los médicos generales en el plan de tratamiento, ya que necesitan ser capaces de identificar a los especialistas que los pacientes con Síndrome de Rett pueden necesitar según su fenotipo específico. Se resaltó la importancia de considerar la pubertad y la transición a la vida adulta, ya que la detección temprana y el tratamiento de las comorbilidades pueden optimizar el desarrollo y prevenir emergencias.\n",
      "\n",
      "La sesión proporcionó una visión general gráfica de las revisiones médicas recomendadas en el protocolo, incluyendo recomendaciones para abordar los trastornos motores y respiratorios. Los problemas respiratorios, excepto la apnea del sueño, no tienen tratamientos específicos, por lo que el objetivo para los médicos generales es detectar la apnea del sueño a través de la polisomnografía y evaluar su impacto nutricional. También se discutieron los problemas cardíacos, con un 15% de las niñas con Síndrome de Rett experimentando prolongación del QTc y ritmo cardíaco reducido. Se aconsejó a los médicos generales evitar ciertos medicamentos, como la fluoxetina, y tener precaución con la anestesia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Se destacaron los problemas gastrointestinales, como el dolor abdominal y la distensión, como problemas comunes en los pacientes con Síndrome de Rett. Se alentó a los médicos generales a conocer estos síntomas, ya que pueden llevar a reflujo, irritabilidad, mal sueño y eructos. La sesión proporcionó recomendaciones de tratamiento comunes para cada comorbilidad en el protocolo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Se discutió la desnutrición, mencionando curvas de crecimiento específicas para los pacientes con Síndrome de Rett. Puede ser necesario realizar una gastrostomía si la alimentación dura más de 30 minutos por comida, y se aconsejó a los médicos generales considerar las razones detrás de las dificultades para masticar y tragar. También se abordaron la osteopenia, la escoliosis y los problemas ortopédicos, con recomendaciones para aumentar la ingesta de vitamina D y calcio, revisiones regulares de la escoliosis y capacitar a los padres sobre cómo manejar problemas articulares para potencialmente prevenir intervenciones quirúrgicas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Se mencionaron las revisiones ginecológicas, siendo comunes los períodos irregulares y la menstruación prematura en los pacientes con Síndrome de Rett. Se señaló que la regulación de los períodos con medicación es un tema delicado, ya que también puede afectar la salud ósea.\n",
      "\n",
      "La sesión enfatizó la importancia de los Centros de Rett, los cuales tienen como objetivo abordar las preocupaciones más importantes de los pacientes con Síndrome de Rett y sus familias, como la comunicación, el control de la epilepsia, el uso de las manos, la marcha, el sueño y los movimientos intestinales. El objetivo es desarrollar un tratamiento mejorado a través de un enfoque multidisciplinario, entendiendo que no es suficiente que los pacientes visiten a médicos separados, sino que el equipo médico coordine y trabaje en conjunto. Se mencionó la falta de un Centro de Rett dedicado en Francia, siendo los centros existentes más enfocados en condiciones de polihandicap.\n"
