Emeritus Professor Jeff Hughes, co-inventor of the PainChek® series of mobile apps and Chief Scientific Officer of PainChek Ltd, discussed the importance of assessing pain in individuals who cannot self-report, such as preverbal children and people with advanced dementia. He highlighted the under-recognition and undertreatment of pain in these populations, often leading to unnecessary suffering and inappropriate treatment with psychotropic medications. 

The PainChek® Adult app, the first medical technology to use AI in combination with smart automation, was developed to improve pain management in older persons with advanced dementia. The app uses automated facial detection and analysis to detect facial expressions indicative of pain, and through a series of digital checklists, allows the user to document other observed pain-related behaviours. The app then automatically calculates a pain score and assigns a pain intensity to assist in clinical decision making. 

Hughes shared his journey of developing the app, starting in 2012 with a grant from Dementia Australia. The app was built in collaboration with a group in Switzerland called nViso, who were using facial expressions to assess babies' reactions to food. The app was bought by PainChek in 2016 and became the first ever observational pain assessment tool to be regulatory cleared in the world in 2017. Over 5 million PainChek assessments have been conducted in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Hughes also discussed the development of pain assessment tools for children, including preverbal children up to three years of age, and children with intellectual disabilities or inability to speak. The team is working on differentiating between cries of pain and non-pain related cries, and is collaborating with the Telethon Kids Institute to build an app for children with disabilities. 

Hughes concluded by emphasizing the need to move from pain scores to personalized pain profiles, as the current scales were constructed for research purposes and do not accurately reflect individual pain experiences.
