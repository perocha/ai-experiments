# My AI experiments

This repository contains my AI experiments. I am using Jupyter notebooks to document my experiments.

## Getting started

You'll need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to install Python and manage your environments.

I'm using Visual Studio Code to edit and run my notebooks.

### Step 1

1. Install Python 3.6 or higher
2. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
3. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. Launch Visual Studio Code and install [Polyglot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

### Step 2

Go to the [1-start-here](https://github.com/perocha/ai-experiments/blob/main/1-start-here/notebook-to-setup-env.ipynb) folder and follow the notebook instructions to configure OpenAI.

### Step 3

Go to the different folders and run the notebooks.
